# Hi, Iâ€™m @Hilal-Anwar ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I am Hilal Anwar, a passionate self-taught Java developer with a love for coding and game development. My projects include games like [Ascii Chess](https://github.com/Hilal-Anwar/AsciiChess), [Flappy Bird](https://github.com/Hilal-Anwar/FlappyBird), and [Tetris](https://github.com/Hilal-Anwar/Tetris). Iâ€™m currently exploring Computer Algebra Systems through [JMaths](https://github.com/Hilal-Anwar/JMaths), as well as Android and web development. Iâ€™m excited about creating automation tools and innovative solutions like management systems and algebraic calculators.
